        <p style ="color:DodgerBlue"> One of my favorite websites is Youtube. I really enjoy Youtube for personal and College related topics. I can always find a funny video or a video that has to do with school subjects for instance, College Algebra. </p>

        <p style ="color:CornflowerBlue"> Another Website I enjoy is Spofity. Spofity is a website where you can listen to music from any where. They have all types of songs and different generes of music. Spofity has given a student discount is helpful. I like listening to relaxing music when I am doing some homework. </p>
